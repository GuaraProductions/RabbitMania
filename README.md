# RabbitMania

This is my first completed project made in Java.

When I started making this project, I had a quite robust knowledge of the programming language
but this was the first time was making use of outside libraries to make a graphical engine, and 
consequently, making a game.

The game is basically a 2D Zelda-inspired game.
